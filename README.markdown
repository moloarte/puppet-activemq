# ActiveMQ #

This is a module that I modified from another module that hasnt been updated for some time

 * Jeff McCune <jeff@puppetlabs.com>
 * [Module Source Code](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-activemq)

it expands the module to have the activemq configuration done over puppet

For now this module needs some general cleanup
I will update this README with instructions as soon as I can
